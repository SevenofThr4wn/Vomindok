## Core Mechanics
Vomindok, like most modern modlists, use Requiem to unlevel Skyrim to signficantly increase the dificulty. Using a variety of different gameplay mods that overhauls the various mechanics that remain untouched by Requiem. This list is very similar in mechanics to modlists to Lorerim, which i based some of if not most of the requiem addons from the renown Wabbajack list. 

## Cities, Towns & Villages
Vomindok uses a variety of city overhaul mods, some of the most notable mods are:
  - Capital Whiterun & Windhelm Expansions
  - JK's Outskirts Series
  - SR Exterior Cities
  - Spaghetti Cities

Vomindok also uses lesser known and frankly underrated city overhaul mods that I have personally tailored to fit this modlist. The most notable is Epic Cities - Soltiide, which was seen in the Nolvus v6 showcase for Solitude. 
## World
Alongside the sprawlling city mods, Vomindok overhauls most of Skyrim's vanilla locations, while also adding some brand new locations that fits into the world seamlessly.
## Visuals 
With nearly 500+ mods dedicated to graphical enhancements, Vomindok modernizes the game's original look to modern standard. That means lush grasses and canopies, rugged weather, intricate architecture, realist, and more. Near everything, from the largest mountains to the smallest crumbs of food, have been given a facelift that is both stunning and internally consistent. Like a lot of Skyrim Modlists, Vomindok uses DynDOLOD to enhance distant LODs and mountains. 

The list makes use of NAT III Weathers, the Lux lighting suite, a modified Cabbage ENB, and several of the best NPC overhauls on Nexus Mods, like Project ja-Kha'jay, Children of the Hist, Children of the Paraiah, and much more which is all packed into a single EasyNPC Merge. 

## Quests

Vomindok does not have Beyond Skyrim - Bruma, but to counter that, Vomindok has a plethora of quest expansion, brand new quests, and new radiant quest mods to keep you entertained.
