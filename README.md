# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This Modlist is in it's early stages of development for public use. Expected alpha release is UNKNOWN

Vomindok, meaning "unknown" in the Dragon Language, is a highly personalized modlist that I have personally developed initally as my personal modlist but have since changed it as an early development public modlist. This list feature modern 2024 graphics, new quests, modernized combat animations, and overhauled locations that are awaiting to be explored.
