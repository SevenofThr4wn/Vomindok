# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This Modlist is in it's early stages of development for public use. Expected alpha release is UNKNOWN

Vomindok, meaning "unknown" in the Dragon Language, is a highly personalized modlist that I have personally developed initally as my personal modlist but have since changed it as an early development public modlist. This list feature modern 2024 graphics, new quests, modernized combat animations, and overhauled locations that are awaiting to be explored.

The full modlist can be accessed here:

# System Requirements 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You CANNOT run this list on an External Drive, it MUST be a internal SSD. Additional Note: This list does not support pirated/illegally obtained copies of Skyrim SE OR Anniverary Edition Content, I will also not be provide ANY support for users using a pirated copy.


Vomindok is a highly demanding modlist to run, please see the below hardware specs to see if your PC can run the list. Just to make it clear, if your rig has 16GB of RAM or less, you will struggle to maintain a stable and mostly crash-free experience, I recommend having 32GB or more to avoid Memory-Related Crashes.
