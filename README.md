# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> This Modlist is in it's early stages of development for public use. Expected alpha release is excepted in the later months of 2025

Vomindok, meaning "unknown" in the Dragon Language, is a highly personalized modlist that I have personally developed initally as my personal modlist but have since changed it as an early development public modlist. This list feature modern 2024 graphics, new quests, modernized combat animations, and overhauled locations that are awaiting to be explored.



# Pre-Installation

Before installing the list onto your device, please make sure that you have followed the below steps to ensure an error free experience. 

- Make sure you make a seperate folder for Vomindok that is NOT in your Steam folder or Steam Library Folder, make sure that the folder is not deep into a file path, because Windows has a limitation of having 260 characters in the file path for applications, including Wabbajack.
